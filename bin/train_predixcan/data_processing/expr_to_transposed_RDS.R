# Reads an expression file in as a dataframe, transposes it, and
# saves it as an RDS object.  If a covariate file is present (as 3rd
# input argument), then it will be used to produce new expression data
# by making a linear model expression ~ covariate, and then pulling the
# residuals as the new expression data.
#
# The input expression file is expected to be tab-delimited, with people
# as columns and genes as row.

# modified by Laura Colbran (1/7/2018) to normalize and split up GTEx expression data
# by tissue, and also to conduct some QC based on read count
