bin/
  PrediXcan.py
    script to predict gene regulation. requires dosage files and a sqlite db of PrediXcan models
  compare_by_group.jl
    functions for statistical and plotting comparisons of groups of individuals. used for box plots in Fig. 5C&D.
  convert_genotypes.jl
    converts melanocyte genotype data from illumina to plink format, with some QC
  convert_plink_to_dosage.py
    converts plink genotype files to dosage as used for PrediXcan
  expression_covariates.jl
    converts melanocyte expression data to PrediXcan format, and calculates PEER factors to use as covariates
  hap_network.R
    plots a haplotype network. called by snp_plot.jl
  locus_zoom.jl
    plots a fairly ugly version of a locuszoom plot, given the SNPs and statistic to plot
  model_comparison.jl
    plots and calculates summary statistics for PrediXcan models
  predixcan_search.jl
    searches predixcan model database(s) for a gene model and returns SNP count and r2
  regulation_over_time.jl
    calculates a linear regression for predicted regulation over time and plots the output. used for plots and statistics in Fig. 5B
  snp_plot.jl
    plots AF-related plots for a set of snps. calls hap_network.R.
  transpose_pred_output.jl
    transposes raw prediXcan output into gene x ind matrix. needed for a lot of the scripts that were already written.
    
  train_predixcan/
    build_gene_models/
      contains top-level scripts used to train PrediXcan models. For models discussed in the paper:
      Zhang_melanocyte_CV_elasticNet.R
        Organizes and trains models on Zhang melanocyte data
      preprocess_zhang.py
        processes Zhang melanocyte data into input for the elasticNet script
      post_process_zhang.py
        processes raw training output into a SQLite db      
      model_parameters_1240k_Zhang.py 
        contains paths and parameters used by the data processing and training scripts
        
    data_processing/
      contains scripts called by the processing and training scripts in build_gene_models/
